# Window Manager Config
these files are for my bspwm setup.
the config files are (obviously) distro-agnostic.
the installer, however, only works on archlinux.
if anyone wants to take the time and make one for debian/ubuntu and fedora, i would appreciate it.

***

## How to install (only on Arch Linux):
git clone https://github.com/blackenedharmony/windowmanager

cd windowmanager

./bspwminstall
